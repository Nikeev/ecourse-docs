Clear cache
-----------

You could clear site caches by visiting ``yoursite.com/update``

If you have any problems with cache clear or don't have an access to /update page you could do it via ssh:

::

    > php bin/console cache:clear
    > php bin/console cache:warmup


Mail transport
--------------

By default outgoing emails are sent via sendmail.

But you can change it's behavior and use any SMTP server.

Open ``.env.local`` in site root and add new env variable:

::

    MAILER_DSN=smtp://user:pass@smtp.example.com:port
