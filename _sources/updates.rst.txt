App updates
===========

If there is a new version of app and you consider to update, please follow this instructions:

# Make a full site files and database backup.

# Download new app version.

# Replace existing files with files from new version archive.
Be careful if you made custom modifications to code.

# (Optional) Run ``composer install`` if you use composer version instead of full pre-build package.

# Go to ``yoursite.com/update``. Script will run database migrations if any and clear all caches.
You will see logs about results.

Manually run migrations
-----------------------

You could also run migrations via ssh:

::

    > php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate -n
    # And clear cache
    > php bin/console cache:clear
    > php bin/console cache:warmup

Free access /update page
------------------------

Update page requires you to be logged in as Administrator. But in some cases you can not be logged in.

To access Update page as anonymous user open ``.env.local`` file in site root and add following line:

::

    UPDATE_FREE_ACCESS=true

Remove this line or set ``UPDATE_FREE_ACCESS`` to ``false`` after all done.
