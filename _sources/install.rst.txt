Installation
============

There are two ways to install app.

- Extracting pre-build archive in your hosting directory
- Using SSH and Composer


Step 1a: Pre-build archive
--------------------------

Extract downloaded archive and find another archive called ``ecourse-full-v1.0.0.zip``.
Upload this .zip on your hosting provider project root folder.
Make sure you are one level upper ``public_html`` folder. Clear ``public_html`` if there any files.

So, you will have:

::

-project_root/
--public_html
--ecourse-full-v1.0.0.zip

Next, extract archive in current directory.

Step 1b: Composer
-----------------

Extract downloaded archive and find another archive called ``ecourse-composer-v1.0.0.zip``.
Upload this .zip on your hosting provider project root folder.
Make sure you are one level upper ``public_html`` folder. Clear ``public_html`` if there any files.

So, you will have:

::

-project_root/
--public_html
--ecourse-composer-v1.0.0.zip

Open ssh and run:

::

    > composer install

Step 2: App installer
---------------------

Navigate to ``yoursite.com/install``, fill database settings and create app admin user.

Note
^^^^

If you have issues with installer database configuration, you can add DB configuration manually.

Create in project root file called ``.env.local`` and paste db config:

::

    DATABASE_URL=mysql://db_user:db_password@127.0.0.1:3306/db_name?serverVersion=5.7

Replace db_user, db_password, 127.0.0.1, 3306, db_name with your MySQL credentials.

And run migrations to create DB structure:

::

    php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate -n
