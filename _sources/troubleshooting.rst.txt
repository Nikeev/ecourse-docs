Troubleshooting
===============

.. index:: White screen

White screen on install
-----------------------

There are some possible reasons of white screen:

* Try to reupload and unzip again source code. File could be corrupted during upload.
* Ensure that web server is looking **index.php** in **public_html** folder.
* Check PHP version. App was tested and built on PHP 7.3 and 7.4

Something is broken
-------------------

Some tips:

* Try to clear cache on ``/update`` page. If you can't access it, use ssh to clear cache from console:

::

    > php bin/console cache:clear
    > php bin/console cache:warmup

* Check logs in ``/var/log/prod.log`` to find an issue.

.. index:: public_html

My hosting uses not public_html
-------------------------------

The easiest way to use non **public_html** folder is to creat a symbolic link from your folder to **public_html**.
